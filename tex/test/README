latticedl presentation for semin-r group meeting.

I made a bunch of demo plotting code in LATTICE.R and
LATTICEDL.R. Each plot is commented. We use make_sweave.py to convert
the R code to Sweave code, and add it to the Rnw file. We then run
Sweave on the Rnw file, producing a tex file. We post-process the tex
file using killplot.py to delete the obligatory plot() calls. Finally
we process with pdflatex to produce slides in pdf format.

R -make_sweave> Rnw -Sweave> tex -killplot> tex -pdflatex> pdf
