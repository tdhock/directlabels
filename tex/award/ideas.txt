1. direct labeling statistical graphics eases interpretation, because
data is used for label positions.

2. direct labeling is currently possible in R, but (1) hard
(positioning functions) and (2) different between plotting systems
(same api).

3. automatic legends are currently implemented in ggplot2 and lattice,
so in practice legends are used when direct labels would be better,
simply because implementation is easier.

4. The directlabels package makes adding direct labels so easy that it
becomes natural to use direct labels instead of legends in everyday
work.

5. System of Positioning Functions + intelligent defaults allows
maximum customizability, code re-use, and user-friendlyness.
